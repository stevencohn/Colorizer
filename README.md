# Colorizer
This project was my sandbox for creating a basic syntax highlighter for OneNote.

The language definition files were inspired by the [ColorCode project](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/ColorCode-Universal), which relies on a set of language rules compiled from a collection of regular expression that match bits of syntax.
